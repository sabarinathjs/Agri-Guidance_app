        <h2>Soil Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Rice thrives in a wide variety of soil types but prefers fertile, clayey loam soils that retain water well. The ideal pH level for rice cultivation is between 5.5 and 6.5.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div className="guidance-section">
        <h2>Climate and Temperature</h2>
        <p>
          Rice requires a warm and humid climate. It grows best in temperatures ranging from 20째C to 35째C (68째F to 95째F). A long, warm growing season is essential for optimal yields.
        </p>

      <div className="guidance-section">
        <h2>Water Needs</h2>
        <p>
          Rice is a water-intensive crop and requires abundant water. It is commonly grown in flooded fields known as paddies, which help control weeds and pests. Ensure consistent water supply during the growth stages.

        <h2>Planting Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with high-quality seeds or seedlings.</li>
          <li>Transplant seedlings into flooded fields for better establishment.</li>
          <li>Ensure proper spacing to promote healthy growth and air circulation.</li>
          <li>Use organic fertilizers and maintain soil fertility.</li>
          <li>Implement pest and disease control measures regularly.</li>

      <div className="guidance-section">
        <h2>Harvesting</h2>
        <p>
          Rice is typically ready for harvest 3 to 6 months after planting, depending on the variety. Harvest when the grains are firm and the plants have turned golden brown.

            <li>
              <strong>Sowing:</strong> Sow seeds in a nursery and allow them to grow for 20-30 days until seedlings are ready for transplanting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transplanting:</strong> Transplant seedlings into prepared fields with adequate water. Maintain a spacing of 15-20 cm between plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Water Management:</strong> Maintain a consistent water level in the fields, ensuring they are flooded during the growing season.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply fertilizers at different growth stages to promote healthy growth and maximize yield.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests and diseases, and apply necessary treatments to protect the crop.
            </li>
            <li>
